Open Data Governance Project

The Open Data Governance Project, launched by the Open Platform Society (OPSoc) in 2025, aims to advance the development and adoption of open data practices to create a more transparent, accountable, and empowered society. By promoting data transparency, the project seeks to enhance public access to information, strengthen accountability mechanisms, and empower individuals and communities through informed decision-making. Through collaborative efforts, the initiative strives to establish robust governance frameworks that ensure open data is accessible, ethical, and impactful, driving positive societal change.
