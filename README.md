# Open Data Governance Project

The Open Data Governance Project, launched by the Open Platform Society (OPSoc) in 2025, aims to advance the development and adoption of open data practices to create a more transparent, accountable, and empowered society. By promoting data transparency, the project seeks to enhance public access to information, strengthen accountability mechanisms, and empower individuals and communities through informed decision-making. Through collaborative efforts, the initiative strives to establish robust governance frameworks that ensure open data is accessible, ethical, and impactful, driving positive societal change.

## What is Open Data ?

Open data, as defined by David Eaves and Tim Berners-Lee, emphasizes data that is freely accessible, usable, and shareable by anyone for any purpose, with specific criteria to ensure its openness and utility.

David Eaves, an Associate Professor at the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, outlined the [Three Laws of Open Government Data](https://eaves.ca/2009/09/30/three-law-of-open-government-data/) in 2009, which are foundational for open data principles:

* **Discoverable**: Data must be easily found, ideally through web indexing or "spidering," ensuring it can be located by users or systems.
* **Accessible**: Data should be available in open, machine-readable formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) to enable engagement and processing by software or individuals.
* **Reusable**: Data must be licensed under frameworks that allow repurposing without legal restrictions, empowering users to adapt it for various applications.

Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web and co-founder of the Open Data Institute, defined open data as "data that is available for everyone to access, use, and share." He introduced the [5-Star Open Data](https://5stardata.info/en/) scheme to evaluate and improve data openness and usability:

* ★: Data is available on the web in any format under an open license.
* ★★: Data is structured (e.g., Excel instead of a scanned image).
* ★★★: Data uses non-proprietary formats (e.g., CSV instead of Excel).
* ★★★★: Data uses URIs to identify items, enabling linking and referencing.
* ★★★★★: Data is linked to other data for context, maximizing interoperability and value.

Both emphasize that open data should be structured, machine-readable, and openly licensed to foster transparency, innovation, and collaboration. Berners-Lee’s framework focuses on technical quality and linked data principles, while Eaves highlights practical accessibility and legal reusability, particularly for government data. Together, their definitions underscore the importance of data being discoverable, usable, and interconnected to empower users, from governments to individuals, while addressing barriers like infrastructure or expertise that may limit access.
