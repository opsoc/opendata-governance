[^1]: **ccLTD**: Country code top-level domain (ccTLD) is an Internet top-level domain generally used or reserved for a country, sovereign state, or dependent territory identified with a country code. All ASCII ccTLD identifiers are two letters long, and all two-letter top-level domains are ccTLDs.  (From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain))
